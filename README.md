## My process

- First I started by placing my HTML content within the tags that I thought was appropriate
- Then I build the CSS design for both my mobile and desktop views (Chose a mobile first approach)
- Afterward, I did the functionality of the project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

While the project may be done, I still feel that I could have done better and improve the code. In the future I intend to redo this project and optimize my code.
